# Rough Image for the Next Decade

## Introduction

- In the privious 5 years, I have learned about various languages, frameworks, softwares, and so on.
- I aim to be a specialist of AI (Artificial Intelligence) in the next 10 years.


## Fields of study

- I think research fields of AI are categorized into 2 aspects, mind and intelligence.
- Study to intelligence gains good results, although study to mind does not seem to be fruitful.
- It's probably because of the difficulty to demonstrate the existence of mind.
   - If machines respond as if humans do, we must assume they have mind like humans. But is it true?

### Mind

- Free Thinking (Spontaneousness)
- Willingness (Wants)
- Intellectual Curiosity

### Intelligence

- Input
   - Speech Recognition
   - Image Processing
   - Morphological Analysis
- Output
   - Speech Synthesis
   - Graphics
- Learning
   - Deep Learning
   - Translation
